The internetâ€™s open system has led to an information age unlike any in the history of mass communication.  Search and social media platforms have developed because of the computer networksing of computers, resulting in the first true many-to-many communication medium. The consequences of connecting many-to-many are uncertain as historically mediums have operated as one-to-many. The ability to make large quantities of books forto disseminate information dissemination, following the creation of the printing press, was the first true one-to-many communication medium. Other mediums such as the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television followed each other and ushered in new ways to communicate but were also one-to-many media. Today, podcasting is the new one-to-many communication medium and we see a rise in podcasters, shows and networks indifferent from the history of the older mediums[1]. Independent podcasters seeking to shape culture need tomust maintain the openness of the medium but there are monopolists who prefer to keep the that prefer a closed system closed. With these two different perspectives on the future, the independents should learn the from history of other one-to-many mediums to make that future more favorable.
