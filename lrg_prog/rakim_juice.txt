Sip the juice, I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place Uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown in the Bronx to Boogie Down
Get strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Shakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge
